## **Get The Edge**

A web application designed to allow a user to see the latest skills/technologies in demand, as posted in the hundreds of job listings on any of the big name web sites.

The results displayed in charts can be invaluable information because it allows you to ensure you're investing your time into learning the correct technologies that are currently in demand.<br>

You will also be able to see similar technologies and how they compare to the most in demand.

**Features**<br>
- Visual representation of the technology/skills you're searching for in the form of charts/graphs.
<br>

- The ability (once logged in) to add and perform crawls for your own keywords(skills/technologies).
<br>

- Searches around 1 job postings per second. This process is in realtime hence why it's a little slow. :) But it's still much faster than a human is reading through each job individually.<br>
- Almost instant retrieval of an previously searched job title and keywords as they're stored in the database.

**IMPORTANT**<br>
When creating and performing a new crawl, please keep in mind that it takes around 1 second to check each job posting and so the larger the search results from the region you set, will determine how long you need to wait for the final results. For this we have excluded the option to crawl through All of the job title posting within Australia at once.
